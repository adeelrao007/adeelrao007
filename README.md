❓Why Me...<br>
I’ve been doing frontend and full-stack work for about 15 years, mainly on SaaS products and admin dashboards. What usually sets me apart is that I don’t just write features — I help teams avoid rework. I’m used to joining existing codebases, understanding the architecture quickly, and shipping production-ready code without disrupting the system. I care a lot about things that matter long-term: maintainability, performance, permissions, and clean boundaries between features. Teams typically use me when they need someone who can start immediately, work independently, and take ownership without a lot of back-and-forth. I’m looking for a long-term collaboration where I can contribute consistently and help stabilize and improve the frontend over time.<br>
<br>
I am flexible with working hours and look forward to hear from you to discuss any upcoming projects and requirements.<br>
